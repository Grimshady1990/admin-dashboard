# Introduction

This project is designed to test my grid skills, this means the layout should be made using grid where possible

# Part 1 ✅

Part 1 is going to be building the first layer of the layout this will consist of 3 main sections

- header bar
- nav bar 
- main content 

# Part 2

Next we need to create grids inside of our first layout items 

### Header Bar

The header needs to contain 2 divs

### Nav bar

The nav bar needs to contain 3 divs

### Main Content

The main content container needs to house 8 divs!

# Part 3

Part 3 is where we start filling the second layer of the layout with the actual elements, (buttons, search, anchors, etc).

I will continue this plan once Part 1 and 2 have been completed.

After completing Part 2 I realized there was a third layer of elements that needed to placed inside (grids within grids within grids).

Now I will move on to collecting all the assets for the project. I will organize assets based on sections starting with the navigation sidebar.
